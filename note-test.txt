USAGE
  asift.py [--feature=<sift|surf|orb|brisk>[-flann]] [ <image1> <image2> ]

  --feature  - Feature to use. Can be sift, surf, orb or brisk. Append '-flann'
               to feature name to use Flann-based matcher instead bruteforce.

  Press left mouse button on a feature point to see its matching point.
